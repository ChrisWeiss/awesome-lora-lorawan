## Libraries

- [Arduino example sketches](https://github.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw/tree/master/Arduino#arduino-example-sketches) - The example sketches, in increasing level of complexity, will show how simple, yet effective, low-cost LoRa IoT device can be programmed
- [Arduino-LMIC library](https://github.com/mcci-catena/arduino-lmic) - This repository contains the IBM LMIC (LoraMAC-in-C) library, slightly modified to run in the Arduino environment, allowing using the SX1272, SX1276 transceivers and compatible modules (such as some HopeRF RFM9x modules and the Murata LoRa modules)
- [DeviceHive LoRa gateway](https://github.com/devicehive/lora-gateway) - This project implements LoRa gateway using DeviceHive cloud service
- [LoRaArduino](https://github.com/lupyuen/LoRaArduino) - Arduino code for connecting to LoRa IoT gateway at Temasek Polytechnic 
- [LoRa Python library](https://github.com/mayeranalytics/pySX127x) -  Python interface to the Semtech SX1276/7/8/9
- [RadioHead](https://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RadioHead/) - It provides a complete object-oriented library for sending and receiving packetized messages via a variety of common data radios and other transports on a range of embedded microprocessors


## LoRaWAN Servers

- [Compact server for private LoRaWAN networks](https://github.com/gotthardp/lorawan-server) - Open-source LoRaWAN Server that integrates both the network-server and the application-server
- [LoRa Server](https://www.loraserver.io/) - Open-source LoRaWAN network-server
